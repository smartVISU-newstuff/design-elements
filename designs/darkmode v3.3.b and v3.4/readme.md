- Copy the files from the subfolders to the corresponding folders of your smartVISU directory. 

- Adapt ./pages/yourPages/rooms_menu.html (in some cases "navigation.html") to icon handling method introduced in v3.3.
  See https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/smartvisu/1851577-dark-mode-smartvisu-v3-3-1 for instructions (in German)

- Activate one of the two designs contained in the subfolder "design" in smartVISU config page. Darkmode will only work with the two designs provided here, but not with the genuine smartVISU designs.

- Versions above v3.4 are using a modified concept for darkmode which can be configured with the existing design CSS files.
